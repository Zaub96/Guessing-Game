# Guessing-Game
Simple Guessing game that keeps track of how many attempts the user has made.
Main use of this quick practice was tracking user input, for example how many attempts were made per try. 
Integration into the discord bot is as simple as adding the code into its own command 
Range can be set to anything; I have yet to test this using negative integers.
I plan on making some more additions such as giving the number of attempts a rating (good, bad, great, etc)
